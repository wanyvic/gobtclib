Description:
Client represents a Bitcoin RPC client which allows easy access to the various RPC methods available
on a Bitcoin RPC server. Each of the wrapper functions handle the details of converting the passed and
return types th and from the underlying JSON types which are required for the JSON-RPC invocations.

The client provides each RPC in both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) forms.
The asynchronous forms are based on the concept of futures where they return an instance of a type that
promises to deliver the result of the invocation at some future time. Invoking the Receive method on
the returned future will block util the result is available if it's not already.
